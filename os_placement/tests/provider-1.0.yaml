# The traits element describes overrides for the provider's collection of traits.
traits:

    # Because agents (such as a compute virt driver) may auto-discover a collection
    # of capabilities for a provider (such as a set of CPU instruction set extensions),
    # and because administrators need the ability to externally associate providers
    # to certain capabilities, we need a way of signaling that certain traits should
    # always be set against a provider -- even if an external actor manually removes
    # the trait association via a call to the placement API.
    always:
    - HW_CPU_X86_SSE42
    - CUSTOM_PHYSNET_INTRANET
    # Likewise, we need the ability to signal to agents that certain traits that might
    # be auto-discovered by the agent should be ignored and the agent should not
    # associate these traits with the provider
    ignore:
    - HW_CPU_X86_AVX2
